It has large showy flower plumes that extend 2-3′ beyond the foliage. Two species of pampas grass are found in Hawaii, Cortaderia selloana and C. jubata, which are difficult to tell apart. Both reach heights of 9-10′ and have loosely clumped pinkish-white seed heads. They flower from July through November. Spent flower stalks are sometimes persistent for several years",

Seeds are viable for 4-6 months, but field evidence from Hawaii suggests viability could be greater. It can crowd out native species, impede access, degrade grazing lands, and create fire hazards.",
